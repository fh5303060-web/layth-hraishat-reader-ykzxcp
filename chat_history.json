You want me to create a mobile app based on the concept of \"bilazmii\" (Methods of transport of materials across the plasma membrane), using the provided images as inspiration for the design and content. You want image 2 to be the background with a transparent view, and image 3 to be clearly represented at the bottom of the screen. The app should be named \"LAYTH HRAISHAT\".\n\nHere's a plan to achieve this:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home Screen:** A welcoming screen with the app's name \"LAYTH HRAISHAT\" prominently displayed. The background should be based on image 2, implemented with a transparent or translucent effect to allow the content to be visible. Image 3 will be placed at the bottom of the screen.\n*   **Content Display:** The core content explaining \"bilazmii\" (Methods of transport of materials across the plasma membrane) will be presented in a clear and organized manner. This could involve text descriptions, diagrams, and potentially interactive elements to illustrate the different methods of transport.\n*   **Navigation:** Simple and intuitive navigation to allow users to easily access the content.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Base color: Light background to ensure readability of the text content.\n    *   Primary text color: Dark color (e.g., black or dark gray) for contrast against the light background.\n    *   Accent colors: Use colors extracted from image 3 to highlight key elements and create visual interest.\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Modern and clean fonts for readability.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-29T08:14:08.729198"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a React Native + Expo 54 app about \"bilazmii\" (Methods of transport of materials across the plasma membrane) with the name \"LAYTH HRAISHAT\".
