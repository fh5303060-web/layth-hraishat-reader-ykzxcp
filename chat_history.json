Here's what I implemented:\n\n### \ud83c\udfb5 **Enhanced Sound Features:**\n\n1. **Click Sounds**: Added immediate click feedback for all menu interactions\n2. **Transport Method Sounds**: Each method has its unique sound pattern:\n   - **Diffusion**: 200Hz gentle spreading tone (2 seconds)\n   - **Osmosis**: 400Hz flowing water tone (2.5 seconds) \n   - **Active Transport**: 800Hz energetic pumping tone (1.5 seconds)\n\n3. **Quiz Sound Sequence**: \n   - Click sound \u2192 Success/Error sound \u2192 Transport method sound (for correct answers)\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 **Key Improvements:**\n\n1. **Enhanced SoundManager**: \n   - Added `playClickSound()`, `playSuccessSound()`, `playErrorSound()`\n   - Added `getSoundInfo()` method for UI display\n   - Better error handling and console logging\n\n2. **Home Screen**:\n   - Click sounds on dropdown menu interactions\n   - Sound information panels showing frequency, duration, and patterns\n   - Enhanced UI with sound indicators and controls\n\n3. **Interactive Demo Screen**:\n   - Click sounds for all interactions\n   - Sound control panels with play/stop buttons\n   - Click sound demo section\n   - Enhanced tips about sound functionality\n\n4. **Quiz Screen**:\n   - Multi-layered sound feedback system\n   - Sound legend explaining all audio cues\n   - Enhanced result screen with sound replay options\n   - Clear audio sequence explanations\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf **User Experience:**\n\n- **Immediate Feedback**: Click sounds provide instant response to user actions\n- **Educational Value**: Each transport method has a distinctive sound to aid learning\n- **Progressive Audio**: Quiz uses layered sounds (click \u2192 result \u2192 educational)\n- **Accessibility**: Clear visual and audio indicators throughout the app\n\nThe app now provides a rich, multi-sensory educational experience where users can:\n- Hear distinct click sounds when interacting with drop-down menus\n- Learn to associate specific sound patterns with each transport method\n- Receive comprehensive audio feedback during quizzes\n- Understand the relationship between different types of cellular transport through sound\n\nAll sounds are properly managed with initialization, cleanup, and error handling to ensure a smooth user experience across different devices and scenarios."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-09-29T08:39:35Z"}]
